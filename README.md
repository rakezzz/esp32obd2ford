- My Equipment
  
  Esp32

  RTC DS3231

  LCD ILI9341 ( 320x240 )

  Testing on Ford Everest 2007 A/T TDCI 



This Arduino sketch for the ESP32 is designed to interface with an OBD2 port on a Ford Everest vehicle. 
It uses Elmduino to communicate with the vehicle's onboard computer and retrieve data such as RPM, vehicle speed, and engine coolant temperature. 
The sketch then displays this data on an OLED display using the TFT_eSPI Bodmer library.



Still on Progress ( Not Yet Finish )
