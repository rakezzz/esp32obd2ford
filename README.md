# esp32obd2ford

This Arduino sketch for the ESP32 is designed to interface with an OBD2 port on a Ford Everest vehicle. 
It uses Elmduino to communicate with the vehicle's onboard computer and retrieve data such as RPM, vehicle speed, and engine coolant temperature. 
The sketch then displays this data on an OLED display using the TFT_eSPI Bodmer library.
